                    The Ganges Delta is predominantly covering West Bengal and Bangladesh. Being the world&apos;s largest river delta with combined waters of several river systems, it is one of the most fertile regions on the earth, thus earning the nickname the Green Delta. Covering more than one lakh square kilometers, this area provides up to three crops a year, plenty of clear water and hundreds of fishes. Thus the Bengali common dish has naturally emerged as a fish curry with vegetables.

                    This super fertile land can support the growth of agricultural plants and produce consistent yields of high-quality crops. This soil with a pH between 6 and 7, contains the nutrients plants need to grow, like nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium. It also contains the other nutrients in smaller amounts, like calcium, magnesium, with enough water for plants to grow and reproduce. This fertile soil contains organic matter, which improves the soil&apos;s structure, moisture retention, and nutrient retention. This is often found in river basins or in areas where glaciers deposited minerals during the last ice age. Soil doesn&apos;t contain toxic substances that can inhibit plant growth.

                    The Indo-Gangetic plain in India is considered the country&apos;s most fertile region. Most of the Ganges Delta is composed of alluvial soils made by small sediment particles that finally settle down as river currents slowdown in the estuary. Rivers carry these fine particles with them, even from their sources at glaciers as fluvio-glacial. The soil has large amounts of minerals and nutrients which is good for agriculture. So, we find volume, variety and quality in the produces of this high fertile zone. Approximately 400 million people live in the Ganges River Basin, making it the most populous river basin in the world.
